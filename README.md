# CSCI596_Final_Project

Goals: Visualize a 2d Schrodinger equation solution. More specifically an electron in a 2D well. I intend to use VisIt(https://visit-dav.github.io/visit-website/) as visualization software. 

Reasoning: Quantum mechanics is already unintuitive. So why not try to visualize it.

Expected results: a 3D graph(animation to describe time) of the energy (described by height) and phase (described by color) of some given wavefunction
